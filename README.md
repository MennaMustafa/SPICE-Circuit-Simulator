# SPICE-Circuit-Simulator
Circuit Simulation Engine:
o The simulation engine is responsible for performing all the numerical calculations necessary to compute the various circuit parameters 
(i.e. nodal voltages and voltage source currents).
It used Modified Node Analysis algorithm with Backward Euler method.

-- individual mini-project can solve circuits contains active/passive elements.
